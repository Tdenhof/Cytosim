# Cytosim
The goal was to effectively distinguish between holes, rivers, and other pattern formations in the cell cortex. Therefore python scripts were written to analyze the fiber:position report outputted by cytosim. This report outputs the position and orientation of each fiber for every frame of the simulation. Variables returned by the report are posX posY and dirX dirY. The position vectors measure the average position of each segment of each fiber and direction vectors measure the average orientation of each segment of each fiber. Note the orientation is reported as Cartesian coordinates on the unit circle. The first step in the analysis was to convert the orientation vectors into polar form. The value was stored as phi and corresponds to the angle between the positive real axis and the line joining the origin and the point, this angle measure is reported on an interval from (-pi to pi). The second step to cluster the actin filaments based of their phi measure. To do this the package sklearn, a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language, was used. From sklearn we used the sklearn.cluster module with the AgglomerativeClustering method. AgglomerativeClustering, recursively merges pairs of clusters of sample data; using the euclidean linkage distance, which is the length of a line segment between the two points.
